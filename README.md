# CS_342_Operating_Systems_Project
Contains the projects that we have done for the Bilkent CS 342 Operating Systems course.
- `Project 1` : Processes, IPC, and Threads
   - `Description`:  In this project we were asked to develop an application that will find the K most frequently occurring words, i.e., top-K words, in a given input
data set. In part A, the application used multiple child processes to process the data set. In part B it used multiple threads.
